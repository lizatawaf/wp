                I should do after year 12. I went to the open day and they helped to decide on studying software engineering. </td>

However both have some ups and dowens. with With paried many people really do know who are they are going to work with so more than 45% of their marks just hanging on someone that may or may not show up. With individual someone can miss out on the experiences from the other party we work with. </td>
